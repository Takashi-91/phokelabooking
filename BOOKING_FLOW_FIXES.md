# Booking Flow Fixes and Improvements

## Issues Found and Fixed

### 1. Room Availability Logic Issues
**Problem**: The room availability checking was inconsistent between booking creation and room units endpoints.

**Fix**: 
- Updated both endpoints to properly check for booking conflicts using `roomUnitId` instead of `roomTypeId`
- Implemented proper conflict checking for each individual room unit
- Fixed the logic in both `src/routes/index.js` and `src/routes/roomUnits.js`

### 2. Room Type Validation Issues
**Problem**: The booking creation endpoint was trying to access properties that might not exist on room types.

**Fix**:
- Added proper null checks for `minStay`, `maxStay`, and `blackoutDates` properties
- Set default values for minimum and maximum stay requirements
- Added conditional checking for blackout dates

### 3. Payment Verification Debugging
**Problem**: Limited visibility into payment verification process.

**Fix**:
- Added comprehensive logging to payment verification endpoint
- Added debugging to frontend payment callback handling
- Enhanced error messages and status reporting

### 4. Frontend Payment Callback Handling
**Problem**: Limited debugging and error handling in frontend.

**Fix**:
- Added detailed console logging for payment callbacks
- Enhanced error handling and user feedback
- Improved success messaging with booking confirmation status
